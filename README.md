MochaML is a community of programmers that care deeply about open source and how machine learning/artifical intelligence can be a force for good. We envision vast improvements in clinical outcomes with the deployment of these algorithms. We believe that such health outcome improvments should be accessible to all, especially those that lack substantial resources. 

Join our community and make ML/AI accessible to all.
